<h1>Hey! I'm Atlas</h1>

<H2>About Me:</H2>
<p>I am currently half way through my ASU journey towards a degree in Fullstack web development.</p>
<P>I was on the fence about degrees and this one seemed to encompass enough to satisfy the boredom that I eventually experience when learning about one singular thing. So far the classes have provided lots of different learnings and experiences. Looking forward to lots more!</P>

<p>While I don't have much other information to provide since this is the beginning of the journey into this field, I did want to satisfy the Extra Credit requirements so enjoy this widget:</p>
